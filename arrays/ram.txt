what is a data structure?
- a way of structuring data inside of RAM

RAM - where all variables/code is stored
- measured in bytes
- typically 8 GIGAbytes (GB)
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- bit is a position that stores digit, either a 0 or 1

integers typically represented as 4 bytes (32 bits)

[1, 3, 5] -> 
1 -> thirty-two zeroes and a 1 and stored into RAM

arrays are stored contiguously in RAM, meaning the elements are stored next to either.
arrays are simplest data structure
integers - addresses incremented by 4 byte
ASCII characters - addresses incremented by 1 byte
